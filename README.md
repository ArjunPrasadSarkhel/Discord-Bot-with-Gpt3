## *This is an interactive bot made with Open Ai's Gpt3 Technology, I have used the sarcastic Q&A bot for this one, Although the bot replies accurate to most of the question you ask but sometimes it is a bit random and is wierd :D*
### Ps- Sometimes this bot can get very rude :p
## Here are some examples of it

### **How can you use it?**
##### 1. Join this server - https://discord.gg/qGb3sMCV
##### 2. Just send a "Hi" or a "Hello" to the bot(Intelli_Agent#4097), it will start interacting with you :D

### **Some information about this bot & how you can use it too!(Provided you have the OpenAI api Key)**
##### 1. This bot is currently hosted on Heroku
##### 2. Log_user.txt returns the id's of the user who pinged the bot
##### 3. I will close the bot after sometime once it reaches a "X" number of request due to having limited usage as it's a free trial and i'm planning to make some more things in future.
### **How can I use it?**
##### 1. Provide your OpenAI key in the environment file
##### 2. Provide your Discord Bot's secret key, in the main Bot.py file at the last line
##### 3. That's it and you can host it on heroku just by using Heroku CLI and uploading all the files I have here

## Areas of Improvement
### I couldn't figure out how to update the chat-log, as everytime an user messages the chatlog gets empty instead I want the chatlog to get updated with the conversation, so that the bot replies more accurately.
